# Message Box with Character Counter

This is a simple **Message Box Web App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to type a message inside a text area with a **200-character limit**.  
A live character counter updates as the user types, and a warning message appears when the limit is reached.
